<h2>About Us</h2>
<div class="reg-form">
Founded in January of 2010, In Zion, Inc. is a technology company focusing on the needs of the LDS community.  InZion.com is a LDS Social Networking and Messaging System.
<br /><br />
Our mission is to enable members of the LDS community to connect and re-connect with their families, friends and Brothers and Sisters in Zion.
<br /><br />
We envision developing new and exciting ways for LDS members and investigators to communicate with one  another, and in so doing discovering new ideas, meeting new people,  making new friends, sharing their life experiences and faith, and creating along the way many new ways to stay connected, on-line and off-line.  Letâ€™s make our world a better place.
<br /><br />
We are headquartered in sunny Los Angeles, CA and are privately held.
