    Administrator,
    <br />
    user {if $uid}with UID={$uid}{/if}
    was trying to use {if $location} Ward's location "{$location}"{/if},
    which doesn't exist in Database.
    <br />
    {if $stake_val} With that user have used Stake "{$stake_val}" and Ward title "{$title}".{/if}
    <br />
    <br />
    Thank you,
    <br />
