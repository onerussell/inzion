<br /><br /><b>PRIVACY FEATURES AND OPTIONS</b><br /><br />
Privacy Settings.  InZion.com allows members to control who can see certain categories of information about them in their "My Info" area through privacy settings which can be located under the "Settings" tab.  Members are also permitted to shield certain individual fields from view by other members, including their friends, by checking off the "Don't Show in the Profile" box next to the field under the "My Info" tab.   Members are advised to consider their privacy settings and "My Info" tab designations prior to sharing information on inZion.com.  By default, privacy settings for News Feed, Basic Information and Journal are set to "Everyone," while all other default Privacy Settings are set to "Friends Only."
<br />
<div style="height:8px;"><!-- --></div>        
Controlling Who Can See Individual Posts.  In addition to global privacy settings, whenever a member posts a news feed entry, including photo or video,  or posts a journal entry, the member can control who sees such postings utilizing the "Share With" feature below the dialogue box.
<div style="height:8px;"><!-- --></div>
"Everyone" Privacy Setting.  An "everyone" privacy setting designation means that the information is available to every member of inZion.com. InZion.com takes commercially reasonable steps to prevent the indexing by major third party search engines of information posted on inZion.com, including information available to "everyone" on inZion.com and information which is not subject to privacy settings such as a member's name, profile picture, and church-related information.  We cannot ensure that information posted on inZion.com which is subject to an “Everyone” privacy designation or is otherwise not protectable through our privacy settings will not be indexed by search engines, and inZion.com assumes no responsibility or liability in the event of such indexing.  By using inZion.com, members assume the entire risk that  information  they post on inZion.com which is subject to an “Everyone” privacy designation or is otherwise not protectable through our privacy settings may be indexed by search engines.
<div style="height:8px;"><!-- --></div>
Name, Profile Picture and Church-Related Information.  Since inZion.com is designed to enable members of the LDS community to locate one another, to connect with members of their ward and stake, and to reconnect with friends from missions, a member's name, picture profile, and church-related information in the My Info page do not have privacy settings.  This information is available to all members of inZion.com.
<div style="height:8px;"><!-- --></div>
Find Feature.  inZion.com, as a social networking and messaging tool, is designed to enable members of the LDS community to locate one another. For this reason, irrespective of the member’s privacy settings, many of the fields comprising a member’s profile in their My Info page are searchable by members of inZion.com using the “Find” feature of the site.  Members are encouraged to review the search parameters available to them and other members through the site’s “Find” feature when deciding how much personal information to include in their profile.  In order to enable members of the LDS community to locate one another, all members will be searchable by first and last name, gender, age, email address, missions, ward and stake.
